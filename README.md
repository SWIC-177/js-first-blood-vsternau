# NodeJS Template Repo

If prompted to install VS Code extensions, do it!

After **cloning** this repo to your computer (remember - don't `clone` into another repo!), don't forget to run: `npm i` and then `cd` into the newly created repo.

# Week 6

I was able to complete the extra credit for the 'template literals' section. I understood that, but the 'arrow function expressions' was confusing to me. Hopefully when we go through this in class, I will understand it more. With using template literals, you are able to save a placeholder for a word/phrase. You can then use this word/phrase anywhere throughout your code.

With the 'arrow function expressions' I think you would do (name) => Victoria. I'm not 100% positive on this though, and was worried about messing up the code so I didn't attempt it.

I was able to follow along with the homework assignment by using your videos for this week and also previous videos. My Copilot did help me with suggestions on what code/words to use, which I found very helpful.

Hopefully I did everything correctly. I know I did accidentally fix some code without committing, so I apologize for that.
